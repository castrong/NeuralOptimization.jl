    PolytopeComplement

The complement to a given set. Note that in general, a `PolytopeComplement` is not necessarily a convex set.
Also note that `PolytopeComplement`s are open by definition.

### Examples
```julia
julia> H = Hyperrectangle([0,0], [1,1])
Hyperrectangle{Int64}([0, 0], [1, 1])

julia> PC = complement(H)
PolytopeComplement of:
  Hyperrectangle{Int64}([0, 0], [1, 1])

julia> center(H) ∈ PC
false

julia> high(H).+[1,1] ∈ PC
true
```
